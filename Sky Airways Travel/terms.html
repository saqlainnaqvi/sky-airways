          <h5>Reservations</h5>
          <p>
            Reservations shall be made over telephone, in person, online or by
            mail without any obligation. Reservation is followed by confirmatory
            email from consultant to the traveler (provided that the correct
            email address is given in time). The confirmatory email contains
            detailed traveler information, schedule, payment, company contact
            and terms & conditions. Flight Reservation / schedule and details
            have to be confirmed/replied by both parties in written (where
            applicable) within 24 (regular) to 48 hours (exceptional case) of
            reservation. For reservations made over the Internet, full payment
            is normally required at time of reservation unless specifically
            stated in the booking process. In cases where full payment is not
            made at the time of purchase, THE MINIMAL DEPOSIT PAYABLE IS 50 GBP.
            The initial deposit is non-refundable and is required within 24
            hours of reservation to ensure Travel Consultancy services and
            maintain seat Reservation. Tickets are only issued once agreed,
            replied or confirmed by the traveler. Issued tickets are
            non-refundable, non-changeable and non-transferable (unless
            specified). E-Tickets (Electronic Tickets) are issued and sent via
            email once full payment is made before deadline / ticket time limit
            / expiry and after schedule/itinerary is confirmed by traveler in
            written and any/all document (in case of third party card) are
            provided. In cases, where no email address is provided, the traveler
            may visit the office in person to collect tickets or request tickets
            in post (mailing/post may take less/more than 72 working hours). The
            confirmatory email sent after telephonic / online reservation and
            payment is "not a proposal" and signifies that the buyer and the
            seller "are in contract" as stated in the email, at details and cost
            as provided and agreed between both parties. However, a traveler may
            request corrections (if any) in response to the email asap / same
            day. After the initial deposit, the traveler can continue making
            part payments weekly / monthly or make the full remaining payment at
            the given date / before deadline. There will be no contract between
            the seller and the buyer until the card is charged or payment is
            made. In cases where wrong card / payment information is provided or
            card declined or third party card forgery/fraud is suspected, no
            contract will apply. All or any call may be recorded for quality
            purposes. Customer feed backs, survey information or communication
            may also be used for marketing, public information or where
            required. However, customer personal information / payment details
            are only discussed with the customer him/herself (if adult or
            guardian). In case of technical errors in online reservation,
            considering that to be systematic in nature, no contract will exist
            between you and company. While in case of Phonetic errors, the
            Verification Officer may utilize all sources and take a decision in
            the best interest of the traveler and the organization. The company
            may require / demand all third party card verification documents
            where any traveler has a different name than that given on the card,
            or where a friend / company or family is making payment for or on
            behalf of a traveler. The third party card documents are strictly
            required for your financial security and to protect our customers
            from misuse of lost/stolen cards through online / phone
            reservations. Any third party using a card on different name is
            required to abide by the third party terms and conditions as
            communicated through the concerned agent / consultant at the time of
            reservation/payment/use of third party card. A traveler who fails to
            provide all third party card documents / bank verifications timely

          <h5>Payment verification & financial security</h5>
          <p>
            Who are we? We are working as an agent to a Principle ATOL Holder
            Agency. The air holidays in our brochure are ATOL protected as we
            act as agent for licensed tour operators by the Civil Aviation
            Authority. In the unlikely event of our insolvency, the CAA will
            ensure that you are not stranded abroad and will arrange to refund
            any money you have paid to us for an advance booking. For further
            information, visit the ATOL website at www.atol.org.uk. Schedule
            Airline Failure Insurance (SAFI) will be added to your invoice if
            scheduled airline flights are booked. For full details of the
            financial protection in place for your booking, please enquire at
            the time of making a booking. How are you secure? For maximum
            financial security of our customers, we have devised a foul proof
            and double check system. In this system once the reservation is
            completed over the phone and the confirmatory email containing all
            flight details is send to the traveler, the traveler is informed of
            the total cost of purchase / charged amount and requested to verify
            the same with her/his bank in order for us to guarantee transparency
            and precision. Traveler/buyer may be required to provide secondary
            confirmation of total transaction amount as appearing on her/his
            statement or the authorization code of transaction. This can either
            be obtained through online statement check or making a call to the
            respective bank. The exact amount (not a round figure but in pounds
            and few pence) must match with our records. In cases where the
            payment as stated on traveler'sstatement does not match with the
            accounts records in our company, tickets cannot be issued
            (compliancy check failure). Once the traveler/buyer confirms the
            total amount in exact figures (pounds & pence) and provided that the
            payment confirmed matched 100% with the company records / accounts,
            tickets are issued immediately. Third party card payments
            requirements & obligations If the card is in a name other than the
            traveler her/him self, we will require a hand written authorization
            letter from the card holder (fax or scan), a colored photocopy
            (fax/scan) of both sides of the card itself, before any tickets can
            be released. Also, a photo i.d. such as passport first page
            (scan/fax) or driver's license will be required for both the card
            holder and the traveler. In cases where the card holder / traveler
            does not want to provide any or all of the above documents s/he may
            switch the mode of payment such as cash payment / bank transfer
            where no photo i.d. or documents are required. One may visit our
            office with all documents and in case where s/he does not want to
            fax/mail the third party card documents. In case, if satisfactory
            documents are not provided, our verification officer reserves the
            right to terminate reservation with or without cancellation charges
            applied. The Payment verification and financial security procedure
            as stated in SECTION 5.0 is applicable in all cases.
          </p>

          <h5>Changes & cancellations policy</h5>
          <p>
            The following Changes and Cancellation policy apply on all purchase
            items / holiday / package / hotel / flight ar other services with no
            regards to mode of payment or mode of reservation. Changes in
            reservation: If, after a confirmation email/invoice has been issued,
            you wish to change your holiday arrangements / Flight reservation,
            we will do our utmost to assist you, However 98% suppliers
            particularly airlines, do not allow changes and tickets are strictly
            NON-REFUNDABLE, NON-CHANGEABLE AND NON-TRANSFERABLE. Any change to
            an itinerary prior to receipt of your final payment will be treated
            as an amendment. Depending on the amount of work involved, each
            change/amendment will incur a charge which will not exceed £50 per
            person in addition to any further costs or charges that we incur
            from our suppliers in making the alteration considering that the
            airline/supplier rules/policy permits the requested change. If full
            payment has already been received amendments may not be permitted in
            the airline policy, under these circumstances, amendments can be
            treated as cancellations and the cancellation charges detailed below
            will apply. However, generally cancellations are entirely
            non-refundable (unless specified). Please note that most suppliers,
            in particular airlines do not allow a name change / date change or
            any changes and may consider this as a cancellation with a 100%
            cancellation charge (where ticket is not utilized as originally
            issued). CHANGES BEFORE TICKET / VOUCHERS ISSUANCE Reservations are
            entirely non-changeable, non-transferable and non-refundable, unless
            specified. However; Changes before ticket issuance are regulated
            both in accordance with airline policy and company policy and should
            be discussed with the concerned agent as rules may vary depending on
            carrier/supplier. Changes cannot be guaranteed and will depend on
            availability of seats/fares and classes. Also, Changes incur cost
            differences / penalty. Once a change is requested by the traveler,
            any previous/existing reservation and fares are dissolved to make
            changes and therefore, if a traveler chooses to retreat, it is not
            possible to offer the same previous fare again, or older/previous
            reservation or seats on previously given/reserved date. Hence in
            that case, any fare difference, charges or penalty will apply
            accordingly to return to reservation on original data. In cases
            where the difference is not paid or agreed by the traveler; yet the
            change has been ordered, the reservation will be treated as
            cancellation by traveler (Refer "changes after ticket / voucher
            issuance") and cancellation charges will be payable/deducted. Name
            Change Before Ticket / Voucher Issuance Please note as airlines
            strictly do not permit name changes at any stage, if you require a
            name change prior ticket issuance; it can be done only through
            re-booking of seats. As we are seller of special and promotional
            fares available for short duration and few seats only, it is
            possible that upon rebooking (for name change) same fare, same dates
            or prices are not available. Under these circumstances any fare /
            cost difference as applicable, will be payable by the traveler.
            Fares are constantly changing and mostly raising, therefore any
            fare/tax difference as applicable on date of name change / rebooking
            will be charged accordingly and payable by the traveler. However, if
            the difference is not accepted or paid, the reservation will be
            subjected to regulations as stated in section headed "cancellation
            by traveler". Date / Schedule Change Before Ticket/Voucher Issuance
            The date / schedule change requires to book the cheapest available
            or closest available fare or any available fare on the new/amended
            date. However, there may not be the same or cheap fare available on
            a new date or any date other than that reserved initially on
            request. Also, fares are revised every 24 hours and the airline may
            revise fares / or raise fares at any instance. Under these
            conditions, fare difference in addition to any date change penalty
            as applicable on new/changed date will be payable by the traveler.
            However, if the traveler refuses to proceed with the date change,
            after the change is ordered by her/him, the terms as stated in
            section headed "cancellation by traveler" will apply. Reservation
            Dissolution / Dissolved Reservations/Vouchers: Please note upon
            ordering a Name / Date change, the details of previous/existing
            reservation are dissolved to make any new changes in your PNR /
            Record. Hence, one cannot revert to older reservation at same costs
            or seat availability may not remain open on same date, once changes
            are ordered and original reservation is dissolved to search for
            changes. If the change or difference is not accepted (after
            ordering), the reservation may automatically incur cancellation
            charges considering that the former dates / reservation is dissolved
            already upon change order. The name on tickets / vouchers should
            exactly match with the names / name order / name spellings & title
            as stated on passport or traveler documents. In case of match
            failure at any level, the traveler will not be allowed to continue
            or carry out journey and the tickets / vouchers will be fully
            non-refundable. It is the traveler's obligation to ensure and
            provide the exact and correct details to agency/airline. Agency /
            company or airline is not liable for incorrect details of name /
            spellings on tickets / vouchers or where the confirmatory
            emails/calls for check are replied in positive by the traveler
            CHANGES AFTER TICKET / VOUCHER ISSUANCE Once the Tickets are issued,
            all tickets are strictly Non-refundable, Non-changeable and

            issued tickets is not permitted under any or all circumstances.
            Where there is a minute change such as one alphabet correct, title
            correction (Mr. Miss/Mrs), or name order correction (Surname / First
            name. title), very few airlines may show flexibility. However it is
            not guaranteed that travel will be permitted on such ticket and it
            should be directly inquired with the airline. The airline reserves
            the full right to acceptance or decline any such request or
            correction. Date Change on Issued Tickets / Voucher: All tickets are
            entirely Non-changeable, Non-refundable and Non-transferable unless
            specifically stated in conditions. Date changes on issued tickets
            are only as strict as name changes, with very few airlines having
            flexibility of one or two changes permitted at change penalty and
            cost differences payable as applied. Also considering, if any seats
            are available for the requested change. Strict date change penalties
            apply on issued tickets as stated in the airline policy in addition
            to fare/tax differences. Also, ticket may or may not be changeable
            at all. Fare difference / revalidation charge will also be payable
            where applicable. The number of changes / number of times a change
            can be made, nature of change permitted, cost and penalty or any
            other regulation is applied as stated in the airline/accommodation
            policy and can vary from class to class or type of fare/season or
            airline / supplier. There may be a restricted time period during
            which a change can be made in a reservation, such as 48 hours prior
            travel or 20 days prior travel. Last minute changes may not be
            accommodated. Changes on day of travel may not be permitted or
            cancellations are totally non-refundable after check in time starts
            or in some cases, on same day of flight / reservation. Expired
            Tickets / Vouchers: ALL TICKETS / VOUCHERS EXPIRE AFTER/AT DATE OF
            CHECK IN / CHECK OUT OR AFTER/AT DATE OF DEPARTURE/RETURN. No
            complaints, changes, refunds or corrections are entertained on
            expired tickets / vouchers. The name on tickets / vouchers should
            exactly match with the names / name order / name spellings & title
            as stated on passport or traveler documents. In case of match
            failure at any level, the traveler will not be allowed to continue
            or carry out journey and the tickets / vouchers will be fully
            non-refundable. It is the traveler's obligation to ensure and
            provide the exact and correct personal details to agency/airline.
            Agency / company or airline is not liable for incorrect details of
            name / spellings on tickets / vouchers or where the confirmatory
            emails/calls for check are replied in positive by the traveler
            Cancellations of reservations Should you for any reason have to
            cancel your booking you must give us a written notice of
            cancellation signed by the person who originally made the booking or
            is traveling or both. Some tickets are non-refundable, while certain
            types of airline tickets (eg Apex Tickets) cannot be changed after a
            reservation has been made and any alteration request will incur a
            100% cancellation charge. Tickets returned will be submitted to the
            respective airline, or their agent, for assessment. As soon as we
            are reimbursed by the issuing airline or their agent we will forward
            a refund to you, less loss of deposit, applicable cancellation
            and/or administration charges. Please note that airline refunds on
            part used tickets and the return half of the airfare are always less
            than the pro-rata rate and may have no refund value whatsoever.
            Refunds usually take 8 - 12 weeks but in certain cases may take
            longer or indefinite period such as Airline Bankruptcies. Please
            note, airlines are directly in control of refund matters, refund
            amount or refund date and the agency is only a communication
            channel, hence bears no responsibility for delays or differentials
            or airline actions. Cancellation has to be applied within a certain
            period (24 hours to 7 days) and after a given periods cancellation
            may not be refunded or entertained. Also, documents, airline
            letters, passport or ticket copies / scans can be demanded to apply
            cancellations. Any other cost/damage claims or any other amount
            other than the cost of tickets / paid value to the agency cannot be
            claimed through or by agency and has to be claimed directly from the
            airline. The agency will only file, apply and follow up the
            tickets/voucher refund and no other claim whatsoever. The agency is
            not liable or responsibly for airline cancellations or other
            actions. The agency can only be claimed for the service charges (if
            paid / charged). Ticket costs/damages/ accommodation vouchers value
            etc are to be claimed form the airline/hotel directly under any and
            all circumstances. However, the agency will provide guideline,
            support and follow-up if required for the "exact amount paid'
            claims. Cancellation by traveler In cases where a cancellation of
            flight/reservation is requested by the traveler, no matter what the
            reason there be, the airline cancellation policy as well as the
            company cancellation terms are applicable and can vary among
            airlines, fare types or season of travel *such as the minimal
            cancellation charges where the e-tickets are not issued are 75 GBP
            per reservation / per person (please check with your concerned agent
            as policy may vary with respect to airline / date or accommodation).
            On issued tickets, the airline cancellation policy is entirely
            applicable where the cancellation charges are determined and
            deducted by the airline itself. *please enquire with your agents Any
            remaining / outstanding balance is refunded between 8 ' 12 weeks of
            cancellation of tickets, provided that if it is received at our end
            or if paid back timely by the airline. The refund is made in the
            same account (as charged from) unless specified. Once the tickets
            are issued, the traveler and carrier/airline or accommodation is to
            deal directly and the agency is not liable to guarantee amount or
            time of refund, service, standard or operations of airline. However,
            we provide complimentary services to apply and chase refunds with
            the airline / accommodation on traveler's behalf. Where the refund
            of remaining balance after cancellation is applied through us, our
            consultants follow up the refund (if any) and the received amount is
            paid back into the account from where it is taken. The date, time
            and amount of refund depend entirely on the airline and its
            respective policy and the company is not liable or accountable in
            such cases. In most cases, flight tickets/reservations can be
            entirely non-refundable, non-changeable and non-transferable *please
            enquire with your agents. Cancellatons by airline A traveler can be
            requested to provide appropriate documents / letters from airline,
            where the airline cancels its flights before departure / return. The
            traveler should also provide ticket scan / copy or any other
            evidence as requested by the concerned agent / consultant. 'Airline
            cancellation' can only be applied for refund within 48 days to 7
            days period in order for the agent to file refund case. Refund
            claims later than the given period or evidence provided later than
            the given deadlines will not be entertained. In case of airline
            cancellation, the airline may provide alternate flight options OR
            full / part refund (depending on conditions / route / status of
            ticket). It is up to the traveler to accept or decline airline offer
            or choose refund/ alternate options. The traveler must contact the
            airline directly in these cases. Once the tickets are issued, the
            total cost is paid to the airline and therefore the refund, status
            of refund, time / date of refund, amount of refund, or any financial
            matters, claims or complaints are to be directly sorted out with the
            airline. The agency is not liable or has any influence direct or
            indirect on the airline offering or operations and bears no
            responsibility of airline actions. In case of cancellation by
            airlines (changes which lead to refund processing authorized by
            airline) shall entitle the passenger to the full refund of all such
            funds that the airlines pays back to us. This figure may differ from
            the original payment made initially at the time of booking. Ticket
            issuance and refund application are two separate activities and may
            be charged separately. In case the airline authorizes full refund,
            there will still be charges applicable by us which will be
            pre-notified before applying for such refunds. However, we provide
            support, services and assistance in applying refunds, acquiring
            alternate options and in problem solving. Our agents can/should be
            contacted for guideline, support or advice where the airline has
            cancelled the flights or is not operational. For accurate or
            immediate information on flight status, refund status, airline
            operations, schedules and airline refund, travelers/buyers are
            recommended to establish direct contact with the airline head
            office, nearest office or regulatory authorities. The agency does
            not control situation, effect policy or is liable for airline
            operations / actions once the tickets are issued. Hence, after
            purchase, airline / accommodation become the primary source of
            information and all terms, liabilities and policies of the stated
            apply. Grounded airlines / airline strikes & refunds In situation
            where airline is non-operational, grounded, suspended, bankrupted or
            on strike, the available numbers of airline head office or air
            control offices should be contacted for precise information.
            Grounded/Bankrupt or suspended airlines refunds may not be the same
            as 'Flight Cancellation by airline' as in these cases the airline
            may be entirely out of reach and all offices shut down. The refund
            process can be very lengthy in these cases and bears no guarantee or
            liability of the agency. Airline on strikes, in certain cases, may
            offer alternate flights or flights with other / code share airline
            or full/part refunds. However, the agency does not hold any
            liability for airline actions and the airline office should directly
            be contacted in these matters. The agents may or may not have
            immediate or precise information where airline is non-operational at
            sudden and no press release / notice is released from the airline or
            any governing bodies. However, airline phone numbers / contact
            information can be acquired and will be provided as available.
            Acomodation / hotel / package cancellations by traveler (Services
            other than Flights): Where any or all of the above are cancelled by
            Traveler or on request of traveler or on late / no show etc,
            Cancellation charges are dependent on the supplier's terms and
            conditions (vary accordingly). These charges vary according to
            whether you have booked a package or other travel arrangements.
            However, Package/Hotel reservations should always be considered
            FULLY NON-REFUNDABLE, NON-CAHNGEABLE and NON-TRANSFERABLE unless
            specified. Should you for any reason have to cancel your booking you
            must give us written notice of cancellation signed by the person who
            originally made the booking. In the case of a package the following
            scale of charges apply plus any additional charges passed onto us by
            airlines and suppliers (e.g. non refundable airlines) depending on
            the date of cancellation. Prior to 71 days deposit forfeited 60-70
            days 20% of total holiday cost 42-59 days 30% of total holiday cost
            28-41 days 60% of total holiday cost 2-27 days 90% of total holiday
            cost Less than 48 hours 100% of the total holiday cost After
            departure there will be no refund of any unused component of your
            holiday. If you are booking other travel arrangements the
            cancellation charges will be shown on your invoice immediately below
            the details of your itinerary. In addition all bookings for other
            travel arrangements (e.g. flight only) will be non-refundable within
            48 hours of departure. We must be advised of any decision to cancel
            in writing and signed by you. The cancellation will take effect from
            the day the written confirmation is received. Any / All packages are
            non-transferable. Hence in case, if a traveler is not satisfied with
            travel arrangements after arrival at destination, after check in or
            after departure or after completion of purchase, and books /
            transfers to any other accommodation/services than those paid for
            and provided in the vouchers, the agency will not be liable for any
            additional costs / charges / damages whatsoever. All requested
            information about packages / accommodation can be provided before
            purchase / final payment and therefore should be acquired by
            traveler prior reservation. Please ensure that all your travel
            arrangements are in place by calling our agents 48 hours prior
            departure. In cases where re-confirmation email / call are not made,
            the agent / company is not liable for any schedule revisions or
            other changes / delays etc. The agency is not liable / responsible
            for standards, services or actions of any party (Traveler / seller /
            supplier / airline / hotel), once the purchase process is completed.
            Other / all clauses as lay out in section 6.0 apply on all
            reservations.

          <h5>General information</h5>
          <p>
            Please note that air fares are constantly changing and usually
            increasing. Very often there is little or no notice of these
            increases, but very rarely do increases apply to tickets already
            issued. It is therefore to your advantage to finalize payment as
            soon as you can after booking, and so reduce any risk of surcharge.
            Please remember your deposit only secures the reservations, not the
            price. Through deposit one ensures the availability whereas the cost
            may vary pertaining to the fluctuations in airline policies,
            pricings, tax and currency. The airline reserves the right to revise
            costing unless the tickets are issued. Whereas schedules may also be
            revised after/before the tickets are issued. All passengers should
            check flight schedules 72/48 hours prior departure of flight (both
            out bound and inbound) by calling airline and final payments are
            determined after recheck of airline policy and pricing as at the
            date of final payment or full payment.
          </p>

          <h5>Airline passenger information disclosure act</h5>
          <p>
            Any information that the airline holds about you and your travel
            arrangements may be disclosed to the customs and immigration
            authorities of any country on your itinerary. E&OE Please note that
            the details shown are stated Errors & Omissions Excepted. * Terms
            and conditions as specified between and included in SECTION 1.0 to
            10.0 of this contract apply on all purchase items
            (flights/holiday/accommodation/insurance/car hire etc) accordingly.
          </p>

          <h5>Deposits and balance payments</h5>
          <p>
            When you make a booking, a deposit of £50 per person is required
            (plus insurance premiums if applicable). The exact deposit due
            should be confirmed to you at the time of booking and will depend on
            the services booked. You may continue your 'Reservation Account'
            through making weekly, monthly, part or final payment toward your
            flight /hotels reservation. Once final payment is received, the
            total/net amount paid calculation, applicable total cost as on date
            of final payment, any fare/price difference or schedule revision(if
            any) to date / on date of final payment, will be notified and
            differences(if any) are payable by the travelers. Please note
            deposits are nonrefundable. For Holiday Reservation, bookings made
            within 10 weeks of departure immediate full payment can be required.
            The balance of your holiday should be paid 10 weeks prior to your
            departure; this date will be shown on your confirmation invoice.
            Please note we do not send reminders. If the balance is not paid by
            due date we reserve the right to cancel your holiday, retain your
            deposit, and apply the cancellation charges set out in the section
            6. "Cancellations". Please note that all airfares / prices are
            inductive and the airline/accommodation or government / controlling
            body reserves the right to revise fares /taxes or prices at any
            instance in which case any applicable difference is payable by the
            traveler at the time of final payment or prior deadline / ticket
            expiry. It is therefore to your advantage to finalize payment as
            soon as you can, after making your reservation. If full payment is
            accepted at the time of booking, the deposit will be deemed to have
            been included.
